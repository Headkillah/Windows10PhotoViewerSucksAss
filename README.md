# Windows10PhotoViewerSucksAss
An alternative to the default windows 10 photo viewer.

This program exists because the standard Windows 10 photo viewer sucks so much ass. It is fucking slow and annoying.

The program was hacked together in frustration and therefore the architecture is abysmal. But it's still better. Programming this was actually the very first thing I did after installing Windows 10 last year, and I've been using it since then.
